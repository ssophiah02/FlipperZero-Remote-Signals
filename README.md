# FlipperZero-Remote-Signals
# To use the infrared feature of your flipper, you can access the "infrared" folder by either using an SD card reader or the qFlipper application. 
# Once you have access to the folder, you can place the desired .ir files into it, including any additional subfolders you may want.

# After transferring the files, you can start using the infrared feature by locating the corresponding remotes on your flipper 
# Then experimenting with the available buttons. Enjoy exploring the capabilities of your flipper's infrared functionality!
